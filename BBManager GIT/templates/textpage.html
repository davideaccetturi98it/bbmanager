<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Welcome to our Bed & Breakfast SMART CHECK-IN system!</b></h2> <br>
<p>Hoping you're enjoying this technological way of checking in, we would like to tell you something more about this innovative idea. <br>
  Everything started trying to find a <b>comfortable</b> and <b>flexible</b> solution for guests who are entering their few-days house. <br>
  Hence, our aim was to be in contact with you even if we were not able to be in town at your arrive. <br>

  <div class="media-body">
    We studied this system by which we manage to open the house door from away, just giving you a combination of rings you should perform
    with the intercom. <br>
    <br><i>You can enter the house to rest a bit after a long journey, without having to wait until our arrive! </i><br>
    <i>You don't have to think about the keys: you will never forget or lose them because you will never need them! </i><br>

  Everything is ready, now you just need to try this system... Have an amazing stay!
