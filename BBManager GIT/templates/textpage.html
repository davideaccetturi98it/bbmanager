<h2>Welcome to our Bed & Breakfast SMART CHECK IN system</h2> <br>
<p>Hoping you're enjoying this technological way of checking in, we would like to tell you something more about this innovative idea. <br>
Everything started trying to find a comfortable and flexible solution for our guests to enter their few-days house. <br>
Hence, our aim was to be in contact with you even if we were not able to be in town at your arrive. <br>
</p>
<div class="media">
  <div class="media-body">
    We studied this system by which we managed to open you the house door from away, just giving a combination of rings you should perform
    with the intercom. <br>
    You can enter the house to rest a bit after a long journey, without having to wait until our arrive! <br>  </div>
